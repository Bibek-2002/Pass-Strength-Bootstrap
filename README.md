Password Strength Indicator with Bootstrap


This project provides a web-based password strength indicator that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visually communicate the strength of a password as it is entered. Leveraging Bootstrap for styling, the tool offers real-time feedback through color-coded indicators and messages to guide users in creating more secure passwords.

Features


Visual Feedback: Displays password strength through a series of color-coded bars.
Dynamic Messages: Offers suggestions for improving password strength based on the current input.
Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap for a responsive, mobile-friendly layout.


How It Works


HTML
The HTML document sets up a simple form with an input field for the password, a display area for the password strength text, and a bar consisting of three separate div elements that represent the strength indicators.

CSS
The CSS defines the appearance of the strength indicators and includes classes for different colors:

.bg-gray for the default state.
.bg-red, .bg-yellow, .bg-green for various levels of password strength.
JavaScript
The JavaScript file contains the logic for determining the password's strength and updating the UI accordingly:

Event Listener: Listens for input in the password field.
getStrength Function: Evaluates the password based on length, diversity of characters, and inclusion of special characters.
updateIndicators Function: Changes the colors of the strength indicators based on the strength score.
updateMessage Function: Updates the text message with advice on how to improve the password.
